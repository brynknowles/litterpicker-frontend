# LitterPicker 

LitterPicker is a single page app intended for web browsers. As a user, this event-scheduling/social app allows you to:
- create neighborhood litter cleanup events
- view all events
- update an event
- cancel (delete) an event
- sign up to or leave an event
- search cleanup events by location
- cheer (clap for) an event
- create a user profile
- view, update and delete a user profile

## Technologies
- Server-side created with Ruby on Rails as a RESTful API
- Client-side created with React and CSS Flexbox

## Inspiration
LitterPicker was inspired by my passion for cleaning up the earth, and my love of picking up litter whenever I am in an outdoor space. I wanted to create an app that connects fellow litter pickers and inspires others to join the movement--all while having a bit of fun and cheering each other on!

## Future Expansion
- sign-in/logout of app with a username and password to create a session
- receive badges for cleanup events based on location category
- add photos to a completed cleanup event
- follow/unfollow another user
- accept/decline another user's follow request
- message board for users
- implement google map api to utilize a map for scheduling cleanup events
- search cleanup events by date/time
- when creating a litter cleanup event, ability to invite others
- share/advertise cleanup events on social media

## Installation
1. run **_npm install_** to install all dependencies
2. run **_rails s_** to launch the backend on a local server
3. run **_npm start_** to launch a frontend local server, to demo the app and view via local host in your browser

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my family, friends, teachers, coaches and especially my wife Katherine for supporting me through this solo app-creating journey. I could not have done it without your encouragement!
